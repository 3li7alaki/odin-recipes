        Shawarma is a beloved Middle Eastern dish, especially popular in Syria.
        This recipe features succulent slices of marinated meat, often lamb or chicken, cooked on a vertical rotisserie.
        The meat is shaved off and served in pita bread, along with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.
        A generous drizzle of tahini or garlic sauce completes the dish.
